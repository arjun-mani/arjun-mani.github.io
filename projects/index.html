<!-- <div class="project">
	<h2><a href="https://github.com/sxzhang25/ima-diffusionmaps">Analysis of product manifolds using diffusion maps</a></h2>
  <h3>Junior Independent Work, Spring 2020</h3>
  <p class="desc">Leveraging spectral analysis techniques, such as diffusion maps and spectral clustering, to decompose product manifolds. Advised by Dr. Amit Moscovich, Professor Nicolas Boumal and Professor Amit Singer.</p>
	<p class="desc">Currently in progress.</p>

		<h2><a href="https://www.princetonds.io/">Princeton Data Science (PDS)</a></h2>
  	<h3>President, 2020-2021</h3>
  	<p class="desc">I built and led a team of ~20 people with a mission to educate and promote data science on Princeton's campus. We organized hands-on data science workshops that reached hundreds of Princeton students, covering topics like regression, clustering, deep learning and tools like numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn. We also organized Princeton's first data science <a href="https://www.princetonds.io/competition.html">competition</a> and hosted industry events (Uber, Amazon, Celonis, etc.). PDS is going strong under new leadership, find out more <a href="https://www.princetonds.io/">here</a>.

		<h2><a href="https://devpost.com/software/a-i-d-a-n-ai-to-analyze-your-data-with-your-voice"> A.I.D.A.N. (HackPrinceton)</a></h2>
  	<h3><u>Grand Prize Winner</u>, HackPrinceton Spring 2018</h3>
  	<p class="desc">We built a chatbot that can respond to user voice/typed commands in realtime and perform basic machine learning and exploratory data analysis. Requires user only to upload a CSV file of the dataset, making sophisticated data analysis accessible to users of all backgrounds.

  	<h3><u>Best Health/Fitness Hack</u>, HackPrinceton Fall 2017</h3>
  	<p class="desc"> We built an app to assess squat technique, using a deep-learning based pose detection model. The app tracks keypoints as a user squats and uses these keypoints to compute metrics indicating quality of technique (e.g. back straightness).

		<h2>Expressivity and Data-Dependency of Pruned Networks</h2>
  	<h3>Final Project, ORF 569 (Theory and Practice of Deep Learning) [Article coming soon!] </h3>
  	<p class="desc">In a team of four, studied the expressivity and data-dependency of pruned networks after training and at initialization. Established limitations on the accuracy of at-init pruning methods and provided theoretical insight into these limits. Motivated path forward for more effective pruning early in training.
